# Hack-a-Sketch
Digital Version of the beloved Etch-a-Sketch. Visit https://devpost.com/software/hack-a-sketch for more documentation.

## Hardware
Upload the Arduino sketch in the hardware folder. Make sure to look at the pin assignments to make sure that the potentiometers and tilt switch is connected properly. A 10KÎ© resistor is connected with the tilt switch to prevent a short-circuit.

Here is what the circuit sould look like
